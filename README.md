# ATP Course Demos and Assignments Repository

Welcome to the ATP course demos and assignments repository! This repository is designed to provide university students and other interested learners with demo projects, example code, and assignments to practice the knowledge and skills acquired during the ATP course.

The ATP course aims to teach advanced technology concepts, techniques, and best practices to help students build a solid foundation in modern software development and other technology-related fields.
